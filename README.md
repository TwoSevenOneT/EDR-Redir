### EDR-Redir

EDR-Redir uses a **Bind Filter (mini filter bindflt.sys)** and the **Windows Cloud Filter API (cldflt.sys)** to redirect the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) 's working folder to a folder of the attacker's choice.
Alternatively, it can make the folder appear corrupt to prevent the EDR's process services from functioning.

### Command Line Syntax

**EDR-Redir.exe bind `<VirtualPath`> `<BackingPath`>**

_To create bind link from VirtualPath to BackingPath_

**EDR-Redir.exe bind `<VirtualPath`>**

_To remove a link that was previously created_

**EDR-Redir.exe cloud `<SyncRootPath`> create**

_To register cloud sync root folder_

**EDR-Redir.exe cloud `<SyncRootPath`>**

_To remove a syncroot that was previously created_
